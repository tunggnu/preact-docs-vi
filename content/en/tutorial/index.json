Why do high-traffic sites like IKEA, Bing, Etsy and\n<a href=\"/about/we-are-using/\">others</a> use Preact?</p>\n<p>The simplest answer is that Preact provides the tools needed to construct\ncomplex web applications out of small reusable pieces called Components.\nWhat makes Preact unique is that it provides these tools in a uniquely\nsmall package: just 3kb of JavaScript code, or around\n<a href=\"https://unpkg.com/preact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one page of text</a>.</p>\n<p>If that sounds compelling to you, this tutorial is a great place to start.\nYou&#39;ll learn not only how to build applications using Preact, but also how\nPreact works under the hood. Each chapter contains an opportunity to test\nwhat you&#39;ve learned, or use the <em>Help</em> button to see the answer.</p>\n"}
